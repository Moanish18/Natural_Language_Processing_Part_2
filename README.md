This project implements an **AI Psychologist chatbot** using **Rasa** for intent handling, **GPT-4o** (via OpenAI API) for empathetic response generation, and **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface. It is designed to offer **emotional support**, engage in open-ended mental health conversations, and simulate a safe space for users in need.
